Use Case:
APT3 Detection Techniques

Description:
APT3 is a China-based threat group. APT3 has traditionally targeted a myriad of US and international targets; however, reporting dated September 2016 indicates the group shifted focus around March 2016 to target Hong Kong organizations.
APT3â€™s process can be broken up into three main phases as shown below:

  1. Initial Setup of command and control (C2), defense evasion techniques, and getting initial compromise
  2. Discovery, privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence, and execution
  3. Collection, data staging, and exfiltration
** Important Note: 
"If you find one of the indicators pointing the following techniques, then you should pivot or go forward and/or backward based-on ATT@CK Model. For example, if you find an indicator around 'SMB Copy' (ATT@CK:T1077), then you are on Lateral Movement phase. so, you can check for indicators related to Execution phase (the next phase) or Persistent, Credientail Access, Priviledge Escalation, Discovery and/or Defense Evasion phases(the pervious phases). Using threat intelligence or public incident reports (related to APT3 - such as FireEye Report, MITRE Report, etc) can significantly and effectively narrow your searches and time."
