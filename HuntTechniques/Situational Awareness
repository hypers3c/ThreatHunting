Use Case:
Situational Awareness

Description:
To effectively hunt, understanding the data you have and donâ€™t have for your hosts is key.  Without this knowledge, you risk making assumptions that lead to poor decisions whilst threat hunting. In this use case, we stated a couple of examples about how to know our data better.

Log Source: 
Metadata 

1. Enumerate All SourceTypes for a specefic time and index
Splunk Query:
| metadata type=sourcetypes earliest=-7d index=main

2. List of All Hosts have sent data for a specefic index
Splunk Query:
| metadata type=hosts earliest=-7d index=main

3. List of All Hosts have not sent data past 24 hours
Splunk Query:
| metadata type=hosts 
| eval "Last Recently"=now()-recentTime (How many seconds ago the last log sent)
| search "Last Recently" > 86400 (Filter just events related to before past day)
| rename totalCount as Count, host as Host, firstTime as "First Event", lastTime as "Last Event", recentTime as "Last Update", type as Type (To be more readable titles)
| fieldformat "First Event"=strftime('First Event', "%c") (To be more readable time)
| fieldformat "Last Event"=strftime('Last Event', "%c")
| fieldformat "Last Update"=strftime('Last Update', "%c")
| eval "Minutes Behind"=round('Last Recently'/60, 2) (Calculates Minutes past from the last log sent)
| eval "Hours Behind"=round('Last Recently'/3600, 2) Calculates Hours past from the last log sent)
| table Host, "First Event", "Last Event", "Last Update", "Minutes Behind", "Hours Behind" (Make results as tabular view)
| sort - "Minutes Behind"

4. View the state of sending logs by time intervals (per 7 Hours)
Splunk Query:
| tstats count where sourcetype=stream:dns by _time, host span=7h
| xyseries _time, host, count

5. Identify hosts that are logging more or less data than might be normally expected 
Splunk Query:
| tstats count by host, _time span=3h
| stats median(count) as median by host
| join host [| tstats count where earliest=-900d by host ]
| eval perc_diff=((count/median)*100)-100
| where perc_diff>700 OR perc_diff<30
| sort perc_diff
| rename median as "Median Event Count Past 2 years", count as "Event Count Past 1 year", perc_diff as "Perentage Difference"
