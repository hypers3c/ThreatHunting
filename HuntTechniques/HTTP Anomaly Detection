Use Case: 
Detecting Anomalies in HTTP BytesOut for Outgoing GET Requests

Description:
When you look at a number of multi-stage threats today, HTTP is a protocol that needs to be monitored; while firewalls may provide some level of understanding, monitoring HTTP on the wire provides the best visibility on your network. You can use Stream with HTTP for examining bytesIn/bytesOut outliers, suspicious URLs, requests without referer and many others. In this use case we are going to detect anomalies in bytesOut.
