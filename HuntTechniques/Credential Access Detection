Use Case: 
Credential Access Detection

Description:
Credential access represents techniques resulting in access to or control over system, domain, or service credentials that are used within an enterprise environment. Adversaries will likely attempt to obtain legitimate credentials from users or administrator accounts (local system administrator or domain users with administrator access) to use within the network. There are many popular tools to harvest credential such as mimikatz, gsecdump, pwdump, etc.
